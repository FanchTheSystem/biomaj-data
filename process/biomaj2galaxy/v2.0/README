This is a typical example of how to install and use biomaj2galaxy.
You'll need to adapt the paths if it's not installed in /db/biomaj/ on your server

You'll also need to create a virtualenv with biomaj2galaxy installed in it:

```
virtualenv /db/biomaj/biomaj-process/biomaj2galaxy/v2.0/bm2g_venv
. /db/biomaj/biomaj-process/biomaj2galaxy/v2.0/bm2g_venv/bin/activate
pip install biomaj2galaxy
```

Add your url and apikey in bm2g.yml

Then you can use /db/biomaj/biomaj-process/biomaj2galaxy/v2.0/bm2g.sh in any db_properties files
